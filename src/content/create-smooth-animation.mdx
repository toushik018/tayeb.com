Creating smooth text animations can greatly enhance the user experience on your website. In this tutorial, we'll use GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) to animate text smoothly.

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have GSAP installed in your project. You can install it using npm:

```bash
npm install gsap
```

<Image
  src="/_static/blogs/gsap.png"
  width={1280}
  height={720}
  alt="thumbnail"
/>

Once installed, you can start using GSAP in your JavaScript or TypeScript files.

## Basic Setup

Here's a simple example of how to set up a basic text animation using GSAP. We'll animate the opacity and position of text elements.

```ts
import { useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import gsap from "gsap";

export default function SmoothTextAnimation() {
  const textRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    gsap.fromTo(
      textRef.current,
      { opacity: 0, y: 50 },
      { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: 1, ease: "power3.out" }
    );
  }, []);

  return (
    <h1 ref={textRef} className="text-4xl font-bold">
      Smooth Text Animation with GSAP
    </h1>
  );
}
```

In this example, we use the useRef hook to reference the text element, and useEffect to apply the animation when the component mounts.

## Advanced Animation

You can create more advanced animations by chaining multiple animations together and using different easing functions. Here's an example:

```tsx
import { useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import gsap from "gsap";

export default function AdvancedTextAnimation() {
  const textRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const tl = gsap.timeline({ defaults: { ease: "power3.inOut" } });

    tl.fromTo(
      textRef.current,
      { opacity: 0, y: 50 },
      { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: 1 },
    ).fromTo(
      textRef.current,
      { scale: 1 },
      { scale: 1.2, duration: 0.5, yoyo: true, repeat: -1 },
    );
  }, []);

  return (
    <h1 ref={textRef} className="text-4xl font-bold">
      Advanced Text Animation with GSAP
    </h1>
  );
}
```

In this example, we create a timeline (tl) and chain multiple animations together. The text will fade in, move to its original position, and then scale up and down in a loop.

## Conclusion

GSAP is a powerful tool for creating smooth and complex animations. By mastering GSAP, you can significantly enhance the visual appeal of your web projects.
